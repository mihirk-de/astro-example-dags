            Ensures each prescription is uniquely identified within a clinic by the combination of prescription_id and gp_practice_id.
            This guards against duplicate rows caused by joins or upstream data duplication.

            Validates that the number of prescriptions in the refined model matches the number in the staging model
            for the given gp_practice_id. This helps detect accidental row loss or duplication during transformations.
